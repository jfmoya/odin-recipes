    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Carne al Trapo (Salt-Crusted tenderloin) is a Colombian culinary gem. 
        This dish features perfectly tender and moist beef with a 
        deliciously crusty exterior, infused with subtle hints of 
        wood smoke and a balanced flavor profile.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pair it with a fresh mixed salad and baked potatoes, and complement 
        the meal with a red wine of your choice. It's an ideal dish for 
        enjoying a cozy evening around the fire with friends and family.
